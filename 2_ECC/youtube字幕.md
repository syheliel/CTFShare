public key cryptography 

# 1

so elliptic curve cryptography or ECC is a form of public key cryptography introduced in 1985 it is based on the somewhat esoteric topic of elliptic curve combined with modular arithmetic some implementations use the same principles as the earlier public key cryptosystems such as diffie-hellman but in an elliptical curve world and this creates a seemingly secure system and we will circle back to that seemingly

so what are elliptic curves these are some elliptic curves notice that they are symmetrical around the x-axis and at the bottom there we have the equation we use to generate these curves 
so this first part we're lookingat sets of points in real numbers this is essentially means we're looking at laughs like in these pictures the next part is our main equation it may look like when you see y equals x to thethird but notice it has y squared soit's a little bit different we also haveto provide two constants a and B and wejust have some basics limitations onwhat those can be and we also add in thepoint in infinity but rooms alsosometimes called zero but this isdifferent than the point at zero zeroand when this we can define an operationon our curves that we will call pointaddition so you want to add two points Pand Q on our elliptic curve we draw aline through them to find the point Rwhere the line intersects the curveagain if such a point exists we dropvertically across the x-axis to findminus R we know this exists because ourgraph is symmetrical so in this diagramP plus Q equals minus R which I knowseems really non-intuitive and weird butstick with me so there are some edgecases but these diagrams should give youa basic idea of how to find the sum oftwo points defining point addition inthis way makes our set a type ofmathematical structure like a group notquite like a group of you and yourfriends but more mathy being a groupmeans that the sum of any two points onthe curve will always exist on the curveand we can actually get a lot moreproperties into our lipstick curve groupif we live it limit our points to be anF P or the set of numbers mod a primenumber P rather than just for any valueon our number lineour group is mostly the same but withcongruences in mod p instead of equalsthe set also now has a finite number ofpoints since mod p has you know zero toone one P minus one so our curve looks alittle different now but it's just a setof discrete points but you can noticethat it's also still symmetrical andaddition still works but it looks alittle different as since we cyclethroughOh in mod P it once you get past P itcircles around and comes back in so whydo we do thisFP gives us a number of usefulproperties and mod pH nonzero point cangenerate what's called a cyclic groupthat means if you add an element P toitself enough you will get back to zeroand then eventually back to P hence thecycle this can be used to reduce largemultiples of P so in our example here ifwe have N equals 12 and we want to find17 P we can take 12 out get 5 and thenwe can also find more large multiples byrepeatedly doubling P and addingappropriately and this might look reallyfamiliar took converting numbers tobinary so to see of an implementation ofthis based on the diffie-hellman keyexchange in our elliptic frameworkimagine we have Alice and Bob who wantto send messages back and forth and theyjust want to shared key so they can sendthe message both ways securely one waywe can implement this is by exchangingpublic keys to generate a shared secretso Alice and Bob choose a public pointon a curve that they both know then theyseparately each choose a private key kand generate the public key which is Qequals K times P they then exchangethese public keys and then to generatetheir shared secret they multiply theother's public key by their own privatekey and if you look at this actuallythey have the same thing now it's the product of the two private keys timesour point P our public point the eastreceives QA and QB the put two public keys but it turns out that those reallydon't help you find our two private keys so we shown before that calculating Qequals Kate times sum P is fairly quick but as we just said though finding Kwith only points P and Q is much harder this is known as the discrete logproblem and is the basis of most public key cryptography the main advantage that ECC has over the earlieris key size so another way to think about these systems is not in time but in energy breaking a 228 bit RSA key requires less energy than it takes to boil a teaspoon of water comparatively breaking the same bitlength curve requires enough energy to boil all the water on earth so as computers have gotten faster other crypto systems have needed to increase their key size significantly MASMA to the mathematics of cracking the ellipticcurve discrete log problem seems to be harder quote-unquote than those of older generation crypto systems as we increasingly need to send secure information over the Internet we needfaster algorithm similarly we now send and receive messages from devices likesmart phones which have less processing power and storage space so we have anecessity for these smaller keys in thepast decade the NSA and other cryptographers have urged organizations to switch from first generation cryptosystems to ECC but not everyone has adopted this for a number of reasonswhile it seems that cracking ECC is inexponential times we do not have arigorous mathematical proof of that so some people are a little bit wary someof the technology is also owned by blackberry and in the world ofcryptography propriety proprietary techis sometimes viewed as suspicious in 2013 some of the documents leaked byEdward Snowden implied that the NSA hadput in a backdoor to a pseudo-randomnumber generator which was people wereusing to generate their private keysthis would allow somebody with a secretto know the output of this randomgenerator so the world of cryptographyis also thinking about the possibilityof quantum computing attacks quantumcomputers don't exist yet as far as weknow but some curves may offer only weaksecurity in the face of a quantum attack and cryptographers like to be preparedthere have been attempts to crack ECC and some have been successful in sort ofa month to week long time frame forsystems with keys under 100 andthis but top-secret information isencrypted using keys over 300 bits andsince security goes up exponentiallywith key bit lengths there's no need foralarm yet so for now we are continuingto use ECC and is being very widelyadopted by governments messaging technology digital currency andsignatures and chances are that you and your device's are using it too these are some sources for further information about the curves themselves and about the issue with the NSA thank you so much for listening sorry
